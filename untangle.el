;;; untangle.el --- instructions to untangle lisp code from config/config.org
;;; Commentary:
;; In order to load personal configurations stored in config.org, Lisp code must
;; first be extracted into a newly created config.el file.  This program
;; contains instructions to efficiently extract all eligible Elisp source code
;; blocks from the .org file and write them into an .el file.
;; Taken on 21Sep2016 from here:
;; http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-efficiently-untangling-elisp/

;;; Code:

(defvar my-start-time (current-time)
  "Time when loading of personal configurations was started.")

;; This is GPLv2. If you still don't know the details, read

(defun my-tangle-section-canceled ()
  "Return t if the current section header was CANCELED, else nil."
  (save-excursion
    (if (re-search-backward "^\\*+\\s-+\\(.*?\\)?\\s-*$" nil t)
        (string-prefix-p "CANCELLED" (match-string 1))
